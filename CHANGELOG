CHANGELOG

*** v0.3 ***
Bugfixes:
- Fixed a very annoying bug where if the landed pile was close to the edge of
the visible area, the game would occasionally crash with NullPointerException.
- Fixed a bug where the newly spawned tetromino couldn't be moved or rotated
until it was fully in the visible area of the well. 

*** v0.2 ***
Significantly improved performance and reduced input lag by eliminating
unnecessary screen redraws.

*** v0.1 ***
Initial release.

CHANGELOG

*** v0.4 ***
Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug where game over could be triggered too early.

Improvements:
- Finally reduced input lag to the point of imperceptibility.
- The background of the well now changes with each level (I was told that level
progression was not immediately obvious before this change).
- Level 5 is now significantly more playable than before.
- Added new level (level 6) which is about the same as level 5 was previously.

*** v0.3 ***
Bugfixes:
- Fixed a very annoying bug where if the landed pile was close to the top edge 
of the visible area, the game would occasionally crash with NullPointerException.
- Fixed a bug where the newly spawned tetromino couldn't be moved or rotated
until it was fully in the visible area of the well. 

*** v0.2 ***
Significantly improved performance and reduced input lag by eliminating
unnecessary screen redraws.

*** v0.1 ***
Initial release.
